# Rabbit Frontend Challenge
This repository aims to provide frontend case study for candidates.

## Description

## Stack
In your assigment, you are required to use:
- React / Vue
- Redux / Vuex
- Typescript <b>(for bonus points)</b>

## Review

During the assessment, we will look into the following points:

* Whether you use Redux/Vuex, React/Vue, HTML and CSS properly
* Code organization (modularity, dependencies between modules, naming, etc)
* SOLID principles
* Error handling
* Assignment completion

## Hints

* You don't need to spend time creating a dev/build environment.
* Third-party libraries are allowed
* As a company, we believe that communication is the key to success. So if something is not clear to you, or if you have doubts on what you can use, reach the devs.

## That's it!

Happy coding!
